## Mission

Cottage Connect works diligently to allow people to test out their small, cottage industry without having to worry about how they are going to attract business. We connect your customers to you by providing you an area where you can setup your store, and provide users with a simple interface to locate you.

Cottage industry laws are out to make it easier for you to test your hand at a small business, but there is still a lot to handle to create your online presence. Most companies use Facebook to setup their site, but unfortunately people don't search Facebook to locate a new vendor to purchase goods from. You are uncomfortable listing your house on Yelp, and your items don't quite fit into the mission of Etsy. Meet Cottage Connect, allowing your neighbors to quickly find out who in their area is selling homemade scones, freshly roasted coffee beans, or their grandmother's award winning muffins.

So you focus on making the best items you can, and let us handle bringing your customers to you.
