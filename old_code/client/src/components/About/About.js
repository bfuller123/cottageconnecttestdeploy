			<p className="AboutText">A cottage industry is a small-scale industry often operated out of a home, rather than out of a factory. Cottage industries are defined by the amount of investment required to start, as well as the number of people employed. They often focus on the production of labor-intensive goods. These small businesses could be hiding in plain sight. Cottage Connect expands a merchant's reach, helping him or her to find new customers. And helping customers support their local economy.
